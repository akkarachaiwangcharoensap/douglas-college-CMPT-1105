# CMPT 1105 | Variable Definition Or Data Type

The variable definition or variable data type is the type of the variable.
In Python, you don't need to declare the variable type/data type. Your interpreter will automatically assign the data type to your variable.

```python
# Python

x = 10 # this is an integer 
x = "Hello, I am Aki" # this is a string
```

However, in other programming languages such as Java, C#, C++ you will need to declare the variable data type for the compiler to understand and process.

```java
// Java

String myName = "Hello, I am Aki"
int myNum = 10
```
