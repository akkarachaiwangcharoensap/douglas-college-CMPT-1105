'''
A particular talent competition has four judges, each of whom awards a score between 0
and 10 to each performer. Fractional scores, such as 8.3, are allowed. A performerâ€™s final
score is determined by averaging the four scores. Write a program that reads in 4 scores
and displays the average score. Your program would show an error message if any
score entered by the user is negative or greater than 10


Name the program file: Q2.py
