A `relational operator` is the operator between the condition.

Assignment Vs Equality
```python
x = 5; # this is an assignment

  print ('x is 5')
```

Two Boolean Expressions

`AND` Operator
If both expressions are true, it becomes `true` else it is `false`

`OR` Operator
If one of the expression is true, it becomes `true` else it is `false`

Mathematics: `2 < x < 4`

Python: `if (x > 2 and x < 4): `
